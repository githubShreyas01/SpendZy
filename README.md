# SpendZy
Welcome to the SpendZy project inspired by PayTM. This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of PayTM, allowing users to perform transactions, view their account balance, and interact with other users.This is a full-stack Paytm-like application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## Features
- User Authentication & Authorization using JWT
- View Account Balance
- Search and view other users
- Send money to other user's accounts
  
## Technology Stack
* Frontend:
  - React.js
  - Tailwind CSS
* Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
* Database:
  - MongoDB

## Database Transactions
The SpendZy implements MongoDB Transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability. Transactions follow the ACID properties of databases, ensuring that transactions are either fully completed and committed or reverted back in case of issues, thus preventing inconsistencies in the database.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
